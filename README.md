# 🖼️ Python Pattern Drawing Project
SoftUni - Python Fundamentals Projects

Welcome to the **Python Pattern Drawing Project**! 🎉 This project is designed to help you understand and implement nested loops, conditional statements, and user inputs in Python.

---

## 📝 Project Overview

Your task is to create various patterns using Python's printing capabilities. You'll build a program where users can choose from different patterns, provide necessary inputs, and see the results displayed in the terminal.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice working with **nested loops**.
- Use **if-elif-else conditions** to implement logic.
- Handle **user input** to create dynamic patterns.
- Understand **alignment** using spaces and characters.
